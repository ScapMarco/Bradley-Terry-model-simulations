# Bradley-Terry Model Simulations

This repository contains experiments and simulations of the Bradley-Terry model as part of a bachelor's degree thesis.

## Data

The `Data` folder contains Excel files with tennis match data spanning from 2000 to 2020. These files are used for the analysis in the project. The updated data (and more details about its format) can be found at
http://tennis-data.co.uk/alldata.php.

## Experiments

There are two main experiments in this project:

1. **Simulation with Synthetic Data**: This experiment is conducted in the file `simulation.R`. It involves generating simulated data to test the Bradley-Terry model and evaluate its performance using different scenarios.

2. **Application to Tennis Data**: This analysis is performed in the file `tennis_analysis.R`. It uses real tennis match data from 2000 to 2020 to apply the Bradley-Terry model and assess its accuracy and predictive capabilities.
